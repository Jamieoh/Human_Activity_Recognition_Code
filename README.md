# An Investigation of Machine Learning and Clustering Algorithms in Human Activity Recognition and Behavioural Prediction using MHEALTH Data

- The following repository contains the Python code and PDF for my thesis which was titled: A Comparison of Deep Learning Models in Human Activity Recognition and Behavioural Prediction on the MHEALTH Dataset.  
- Investigation of deep learning and dimensionality reduction techniques in human activity recognition and behavioural prediction. 
- These techniques combined with multiple sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) from the MHEALTH dataset aimed to classify daily activities. 
- Conducted an investigation and compared six different deep learning algorithms (CNN, LSTM, CNN + LSTM Hybrid, Autoencoder w. Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, XGBoost) with each other to evaluate which network best suited the MHEALTH dataset. 
- Another intriguing aim of this research was to compare two data clustering techniques for visualising the MHEALTH dataset. 
- Presented the best visualization technique by conducting a comparative study on the two visualisation techniques (t-SNE + DBSCAN).
